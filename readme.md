## 🚀 About the Project

Welcome to the **Memory Card Matching Game** — a classic web-based game designed to challenge your memory and reflexes. Whether you're here to train your brain or just kill a few minutes, this game brings a simple idea to life with some slick frontend magic.

I built this project to sharpen my JavaScript skills, explore DOM manipulation, and have fun creating something that anyone can enjoy in a browser.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. 🃏 Click on any two cards to flip them.
2. ✅ If they match, they stay flipped!
3. ❌ If they don't match, they flip back — so remember their positions!
4. 🔄 Match all pairs with the fewest moves possible.

It's that easy... but can you master it?
